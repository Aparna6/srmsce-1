                  <p>The SRM Society of Civil Engineers organized an awareness program on 21st August 2018 on the topic “Faecal Sludge Management” at 1.30PM in CRC Seminar Hall by Prof. Anil Dutt Vyas from Manipal University, Jaipur. The guest lecture started with welcome address and introducing the speaker by Dr. K. S. Satyanarayanan, Professor and Head, Department of Civil Engineering, SRMIST. 
                    The speaker presented the lecture with brief introduction on the importance of Faecal Sludge Management(FSM). He explained that India is a developing country with its per capita income rank being 106 out of 132 countries and how it is affecting the infant and child mortality rate. According to him, typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, etc. are among the top ten diseases causing death among infants and children in developing countries. And improper sewage disposal and treatment are the main causes of infant and child mortality rate. Open defecation causes malnutrition among children and infants and stunts their growth. He explained how Swach Bharat Mission aims at removing open defecation and similar global projects that had been initiated like Millennium Development Goals which aimed at half the world population having access to safe water and sanitation by 2015; Sustainable Development Goals which aims that the whole world population will have equitable access to safe water and sanitation by 2030 and Reinventing the toilet system, 2017, proposed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) which aims at reinventing the toilets where less water is going to be used.
                    </p>
                    <img src="Resources/images/events/event12-2.jpg" />
                  <p>According to surveys conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, 6 in 10 people lack safe sanitation and 3 in 10 people lack safe water. Statistically, 63 percent of sewage generated in India is not treated. In the world, as of today, 2.7 billion people need FSM and by 2030, that number will increase to 5 billion people. Prof. Vyas continued his lecture by explaining the students the basic terminologies of faecal sludge management. He explained the different types of on-site sanitation like pit latrines, septic tanks, etc. and what is the difference between them. He enlightened the students with the difference between the black water, which is wastewater along with faecal waste, and grey water, which is the wastewater excluding faecal waste. He also told them about the different methods and means of collection and transportation of faecal sludge, like, manual collection techniques, mechanized collection techniques, etc. The different treatment objectives and treatment mechanisms of faecal management were also mentioned. The speaker then explained Omni Processor, proposed by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which treats and processes faecal sludge in countries like Sudan, etc. He concluded his speech by encouraging the students to take an online course on faecal sludge management. Around 100 students and 28 faculty members from Civil Engineering. Research Institute, Centre for Environmental Nuclear Research and School of Public Health participated in the lecture. </p>

                  <p>An Industrial visit to Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research , Kalpakkam was organized by the Civil  Engineering department of SRM Institute of Science and Technology on Friday, 10th August 2018,. M.Tech Environmental Engineering students (I st and II nd years) accompanied two faculties Mr. S.DHANASEKAR and Ms. V.MIRUNALINI visited IGCAR, Kalpakkam to interact with the scientists to understand the fast reactor science and technology and their effects on the environment. In this visit students were very eagerly waiting for listening to the centre’s scientists.
                    In the morning at 9.30 a.m we visited IGCAR,Kalpakkam. The Head of the BARC  training school, IGCAR Campus, conducted a very informative introductory session  for the students. Also she motivated the students to select their domain and area of interest. The team then observed the pictorial representation of the operations taking place in the fast breeder reactor. This session was followed by the control room visit. Dr. R. Mathiyarasu,Senior Scientist IGCAR – Radiology Safety Division, explained the students about the radiations that are emitted from the reactors. He also demonstrated the Environment, Health and  safety precaution methods. The testing laboratory equipments were explained. Then the students were given knowledge about the artificial Earthquake Stimulator and their operation mechanisms.
                    </p>
                    <p>The session was concluded with Question – Answer session. Many of the students asked different questions  to the senior scientist. All the students were satisfied after the session. The visit came to an end at 3.30 p.m.Finally, we left the premises around 3.45 p.m .It was an informative, interesting and successful visit. We express our sincere gratitude to all the members of IGCAR who spent their valuable time for us.

                  <p>In Yercaud, many areas are potentially endangered by soil erosion and landslides. The soil erosion will wash away the top shallow soil and results in loss of soil fertility whereas landslides are the threat for safety of local people and touristers. A Project Team of SRM Institute of Science and Technology have proposed the economical and eco-friendly protection technique for soil erosion and landslides based on the findings of their previous research. The proposed soil erosion and landslide protection technique is bio-reinforcing the soil by vegetative cover. In association with District Rural Development Agency of Salem, the project team have done the vegetation at the identified site in Yercaud Block Development Office Campus which parts are endangered by soil erosion and landslides.</p>

                  <p>Panchayat Secretary of Yercaud Panchayat and his team is taken care of watering the plants, and monitoring it’s growth. Further, the strength gaining factors of vegetated site and quantification of soil erosion control by vegetation have to be evaluated by the field and laboratory testings in Phase II of the project.</p>

                  <p>Anti-Plastic awareness rally was held at Manjakuttai panchayat of Yercaud. The event was coordinated by the Students from the Civil Department of SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Chennai, in association with Yercaud Panchayat Union and Manjakuttai Panchayat. Along with the Students of SRMIST, Yercaud Union Health Inspector Mr. Selvakumar, Manjakuttai Medical Officer Dr. Ramanathan, Manjakuttai Panchayat Secretary Mr. Saravanan, Assistant Professors of SRMIST Mr. Chezhiyan, Mr. Ganpathy Ramasamy, and Mr. Edwin were present in the event. </p>
                  <img src="Resources/images/events/evnt51-2.jpg" />
                  <p>The rally started from the Panchayat office of Manjakuttai. The students carried placards with slogans against the use of plastics and spoke earnestly to the vendors, customers and owners of grocery stores, telling them about the harmful effects of plastics and they raised voice against the usage of plastics during the rally. Further the group explained the shop keepers about the implementation of the State-wide plastic ban which is scheduled to begin from January 1, 2019. “A piece of plastic used for a couple of minutes takes hundreds of years to completely destroy. We see tanks, roads and dustbins choked with plastic causing problems both for the present and the future generations,” said the faculty members of SRMIST. Finally the students group asked the shop keepers and people to stop using single using plastics such as plastic bags, straws and plates and, instead, use traditional banana leaves, areca wooden plates, cloth bags and jute bags.</p>

                  <p>           An Industrial visit to Sewage Treatment Plant(120MLD), Koyambedu, owned and maintained by Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board(CMWSSB) was organized by Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty  of Engineering & Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur on 20.2.2019. A team of 7 M.Tech Environmental Engineering students and 15 B.Tech Civil Engineering students along two faculty members of Environmental Engineering specialization Mr. K.Prasanna and Mr. S. Dhanasekar visited the plant. The officials briefed about the process involved in the STP with the introductory session on the layout as a miniature model of the whole treatment plant for the students and followed by visit to each treatment unit. One of the chemist, Mr. R. Ilayakumar who was accompanied with the team and explained about each unit like Screening, Primary Settling, Aeration, Digester, Secondary Settling and Chlorination. He also mentioned that, it is one among the biggest treatment plant in Tamil Nadu which treats the domestic wastewater from 13 zones of Chennai city and has a capacity of 120 MLD. 
                    <br>The students gained knowledge about practical application of sewage treatment and how the impurities are removed at various levels. The sludge removed from the primary clarifier is fed into the digestor thickener for the production of biogas and later in the gas holding tank. The gas H2S is removed by adding sodium hydroxide to prevent corrosion. The treated effluent is send to Sriperumbudur through underground conduits for industrial usage. Finally visit to lab to know how the characteristics of sewage is done at various stages and noted daily. The chemist also pointed out the standards prescribed by the TNPCB. During the visit,students interaction with officials and the chemist were very much appreciated.

                  <p>           An Industrial visit to Sewage Treatment Plant(120MLD), Koyambedu, owned and maintained by Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board(CMWSSB) was organized by Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty  of Engineering & Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur on 20.2.2019. A team of 7 M.Tech Environmental Engineering students and 15 B.Tech Civil Engineering students along two faculty members of Environmental Engineering specialization Mr. K.Prasanna and Mr. S. Dhanasekar visited the plant. The officials briefed about the process involved in the STP with the introductory session on the layout as a miniature model of the whole treatment plant for the students and followed by visit to each treatment unit. One of the chemist, Mr. R. Ilayakumar who was accompanied with the team and explained about each unit like Screening, Primary Settling, Aeration, Digester, Secondary Settling and Chlorination. He also mentioned that, it is one among the biggest treatment plant in Tamil Nadu which treats the domestic wastewater from 13 zones of Chennai city and has a capacity of 120 MLD. 
                    <br>The students gained knowledge about practical application of sewage treatment and how the impurities are removed at various levels. The sludge removed from the primary clarifier is fed into the digestor thickener for the production of biogas and later in the gas holding tank. The gas H2S is removed by adding sodium hydroxide to prevent corrosion. The treated effluent is send to Sriperumbudur through underground conduits for industrial usage. Finally visit to lab to know how the characteristics of sewage is done at various stages and noted daily. The chemist also pointed out the standards prescribed by the TNPCB. During the visit,students interaction with officials and the chemist were very much appreciated.
