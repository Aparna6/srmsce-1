                  <p>The SRM Society of Civil Engineers organized an awareness program on 21st August 2018 on the topic “Faecal Sludge Management” at 1.30PM in CRC Seminar Hall by Prof. Anil Dutt Vyas from Manipal University, Jaipur. The guest lecture started with welcome address and introducing the speaker by Dr. K. S. Satyanarayanan, Professor and Head, Department of Civil Engineering, SRMIST. 
                    The speaker presented the lecture with brief introduction on the importance of Faecal Sludge Management(FSM). He explained that India is a developing country with its per capita income rank being 106 out of 132 countries and how it is affecting the infant and child mortality rate. According to him, typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, etc. are among the top ten diseases causing death among infants and children in developing countries. And improper sewage disposal and treatment are the main causes of infant and child mortality rate. Open defecation causes malnutrition among children and infants and stunts their growth. He explained how Swach Bharat Mission aims at removing open defecation and similar global projects that had been initiated like Millennium Development Goals which aimed at half the world population having access to safe water and sanitation by 2015; Sustainable Development Goals which aims that the whole world population will have equitable access to safe water and sanitation by 2030 and Reinventing the toilet system, 2017, proposed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) which aims at reinventing the toilets where less water is going to be used.
                    </p>
                    <img src="Resources/images/events/event12-2.jpg" />
                  <p>According to surveys conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, 6 in 10 people lack safe sanitation and 3 in 10 people lack safe water. Statistically, 63 percent of sewage generated in India is not treated. In the world, as of today, 2.7 billion people need FSM and by 2030, that number will increase to 5 billion people. Prof. Vyas continued his lecture by explaining the students the basic terminologies of faecal sludge management. He explained the different types of on-site sanitation like pit latrines, septic tanks, etc. and what is the difference between them. He enlightened the students with the difference between the black water, which is wastewater along with faecal waste, and grey water, which is the wastewater excluding faecal waste. He also told them about the different methods and means of collection and transportation of faecal sludge, like, manual collection techniques, mechanized collection techniques, etc. The different treatment objectives and treatment mechanisms of faecal management were also mentioned. The speaker then explained Omni Processor, proposed by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which treats and processes faecal sludge in countries like Sudan, etc. He concluded his speech by encouraging the students to take an online course on faecal sludge management. Around 100 students and 28 faculty members from Civil Engineering. Research Institute, Centre for Environmental Nuclear Research and School of Public Health participated in the lecture. </p>

                  <p>An Industrial visit to Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research , Kalpakkam was organized by the Civil  Engineering department of SRM Institute of Science and Technology on Friday, 10th August 2018,. M.Tech Environmental Engineering students (I st and II nd years) accompanied two faculties Mr. S.DHANASEKAR and Ms. V.MIRUNALINI visited IGCAR, Kalpakkam to interact with the scientists to understand the fast reactor science and technology and their effects on the environment. In this visit students were very eagerly waiting for listening to the centre’s scientists.
                    In the morning at 9.30 a.m we visited IGCAR,Kalpakkam. The Head of the BARC  training school, IGCAR Campus, conducted a very informative introductory session  for the students. Also she motivated the students to select their domain and area of interest. The team then observed the pictorial representation of the operations taking place in the fast breeder reactor. This session was followed by the control room visit. Dr. R. Mathiyarasu,Senior Scientist IGCAR – Radiology Safety Division, explained the students about the radiations that are emitted from the reactors. He also demonstrated the Environment, Health and  safety precaution methods. The testing laboratory equipments were explained. Then the students were given knowledge about the artificial Earthquake Stimulator and their operation mechanisms.
                    </p>
                    <p>The session was concluded with Question – Answer session. Many of the students asked different questions  to the senior scientist. All the students were satisfied after the session. The visit came to an end at 3.30 p.m.Finally, we left the premises around 3.45 p.m .It was an informative, interesting and successful visit. We express our sincere gratitude to all the members of IGCAR who spent their valuable time for us.

The guest lecture started with welcome address and introducing the speaker by Dr. K. S. Satyanarayanan, Professor and Head, Department of Civil Engineering, SRMIST. 
                    The speaker presented the lecture with brief introduction on the importance of Faecal Sludge Management(FSM). He explained that India is a developing country with its per capita income rank being 106 out of 132 countries and how it is affecting the infant and child mortality rate. According to him, typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, etc. are among the top ten diseases causing death among infants and children in developing countries. And improper sewage disposal and treatment are the main causes of infant and child mortality rate. Open defecation causes malnutrition among children and infants and stunts their growth. He explained how Swach Bharat Mission aims at removing open defecation and similar global projects that had been initiated like Millennium Development Goals which aimed at half the world population having access to safe water and sanitation by 2015; Sustainable Development Goals which aims that the whole world population will have equitable access to safe water and sanitation by 2030 and Reinventing the toilet system, 2017, proposed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) which aims at reinventing the toilets where less water is going to be used.

                  <p>According to surveys conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, 6 in 10 people lack safe sanitation and 3 in 10 people lack safe water. Statistically, 63 percent of sewage generated in India is not treated. In the world, as of today, 2.7 billion people need FSM and by 2030, that number will increase to 5 billion people. Prof. Vyas continued his lecture by explaining the students the basic terminologies of faecal sludge management. He explained the different types of on-site sanitation like pit latrines, septic tanks, etc. and what is the difference between them. He enlightened the students with the difference between the black water, which is wastewater along with faecal waste, and grey water, which is the wastewater excluding faecal waste. He also told them about the different methods and means of collection and transportation of faecal sludge, like, manual collection techniques, mechanized collection techniques, etc. The different treatment objectives and treatment mechanisms of faecal management were also mentioned. The speaker then explained Omni Processor, proposed by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which treats and processes faecal sludge in countries like Sudan, etc. He concluded his speech by encouraging the students to take an online course on faecal sludge management. Around 100 students and 28 faculty members from Civil Engineering. Research Institute, Centre for Environmental Nuclear Research and School of Public Health participated in the lecture. </p>

                  <p>An Industrial visit to Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research , Kalpakkam was organized by the Civil  Engineering department of SRM Institute of Science and Technology on Friday, 10th August 2018,. M.Tech Environmental Engineering students (I st and II nd years) accompanied two faculties Mr. S.DHANASEKAR and Ms. V.MIRUNALINI visited IGCAR, Kalpakkam to interact with the scientists to understand the fast reactor science and technology and their effects on the environment. In this visit students were very eagerly waiting for listening to the centre’s scientists.
                    In the morning at 9.30 a.m we visited IGCAR,Kalpakkam. The Head of the BARC  training school, IGCAR Campus, conducted a very informative introductory session  for the students. Also she motivated the students to select their domain and area of interest. The team then observed the pictorial representation of the operations taking place in the fast breeder reactor. This session was followed by the control room visit. Dr. R. Mathiyarasu,Senior Scientist IGCAR – Radiology Safety Division, explained the students about the radiations that are emitted from the reactors. He also demonstrated the Environment, Health and  safety precaution methods. The testing laboratory equipments were explained. Then the students were given knowledge about the artificial Earthquake Stimulator and their operation mechanisms.

                  <p>The SRM Society of Civil Engineers organized an awareness program on 21st August 2018 on the topic “Faecal Sludge Management” at 1.30PM in CRC Seminar Hall by Prof. Anil Dutt Vyas from Manipal University, Jaipur. The guest lecture started with welcome address and introducing the speaker by Dr. K. S. Satyanarayanan, Professor and Head, Department of Civil Engineering, SRMIST. 
                    The speaker presented the lecture with brief introduction on the importance of Faecal Sludge Management(FSM). He explained that India is a developing country with its per capita income rank being 106 out of 132 countries and how it is affecting the infant and child mortality rate. According to him, typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, etc. are among the top ten diseases causing death among infants and children in developing countries. And improper sewage disposal and treatment are the main causes of infant and child mortality rate. Open defecation causes malnutrition among children and infants and stunts their growth. He explained how Swach Bharat Mission aims at removing open defecation and similar global projects that had been initiated like Millennium Development Goals which aimed at half the world population having access to safe water and sanitation by 2015; Sustainable Development Goals which aims that the whole world population will have equitable access to safe water and sanitation by 2030 and Reinventing the toilet system, 2017, proposed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) which aims at reinventing the toilets where less water is going to be used.

                  <p>According to surveys conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, 6 in 10 people lack safe sanitation and 3 in 10 people lack safe water. Statistically, 63 percent of sewage generated in India is not treated. In the world, as of today, 2.7 billion people need FSM and by 2030, that number will increase to 5 billion people. Prof. Vyas continued his lecture by explaining the students the basic terminologies of faecal sludge management. He explained the different types of on-site sanitation like pit latrines, septic tanks, etc. and what is the difference between them. He enlightened the students with the difference between the black water, which is wastewater along with faecal waste, and grey water, which is the wastewater excluding faecal waste. He also told them about the different methods and means of collection and transportation of faecal sludge, like, manual collection techniques, mechanized collection techniques, etc. The different treatment objectives and treatment mechanisms of faecal management were also mentioned. The speaker then explained Omni Processor, proposed by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which treats and processes faecal sludge in countries like Sudan, etc. He concluded his speech by encouraging the students to take an online course on faecal sludge management. Around 100 students and 28 faculty members from Civil Engineering. Research Institute, Centre for Environmental Nuclear Research and School of Public Health participated in the lecture. </p>

                  <p>An Industrial visit to Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research , Kalpakkam was organized by the Civil  Engineering department of SRM Institute of Science and Technology on Friday, 10th August 2018,. M.Tech Environmental Engineering students (I st and II nd years) accompanied two faculties Mr. S.DHANASEKAR and Ms. V.MIRUNALINI visited IGCAR, Kalpakkam to interact with the scientists to understand the fast reactor science and technology and their effects on the environment. In this visit students were very eagerly waiting for listening to the centre’s scientists.
                    In the morning at 9.30 a.m we visited IGCAR,Kalpakkam. The Head of the BARC  training school, IGCAR Campus, conducted a very informative introductory session  for the students. Also she motivated the students to select their domain and area of interest. The team then observed the pictorial representation of the operations taking place in the fast breeder reactor. This session was followed by the control room visit. Dr. R. Mathiyarasu,Senior Scientist IGCAR – Radiology Safety Division, explained the students about the radiations that are emitted from the reactors. He also demonstrated the Environment, Health and  safety precaution methods. The testing laboratory equipments were explained. Then the students were given knowledge about the artificial Earthquake Stimulator and their operation mechanisms.

                  <p>The SRM Society of Civil Engineers organized an awareness program on 21st August 2018 on the topic “Faecal Sludge Management” at 1.30PM in CRC Seminar Hall by Prof. Anil Dutt Vyas from Manipal University, Jaipur. The guest lecture started with welcome address and introducing the speaker by Dr. K. S. Satyanarayanan, Professor and Head, Department of Civil Engineering, SRMIST. 
                    The speaker presented the lecture with brief introduction on the importance of Faecal Sludge Management(FSM). He explained that India is a developing country with its per capita income rank being 106 out of 132 countries and how it is affecting the infant and child mortality rate. According to him, typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, etc. are among the top ten diseases causing death among infants and children in developing countries. And improper sewage disposal and treatment are the main causes of infant and child mortality rate. Open defecation causes malnutrition among children and infants and stunts their growth. He explained how Swach Bharat Mission aims at removing open defecation and similar global projects that had been initiated like Millennium Development Goals which aimed at half the world population having access to safe water and sanitation by 2015; Sustainable Development Goals which aims that the whole world population will have equitable access to safe water and sanitation by 2030 and Reinventing the toilet system, 2017, proposed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) which aims at reinventing the toilets where less water is going to be used.

                  <p>According to surveys conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, 6 in 10 people lack safe sanitation and 3 in 10 people lack safe water. Statistically, 63 percent of sewage generated in India is not treated. In the world, as of today, 2.7 billion people need FSM and by 2030, that number will increase to 5 billion people. Prof. Vyas continued his lecture by explaining the students the basic terminologies of faecal sludge management. He explained the different types of on-site sanitation like pit latrines, septic tanks, etc. and what is the difference between them. He enlightened the students with the difference between the black water, which is wastewater along with faecal waste, and grey water, which is the wastewater excluding faecal waste. He also told them about the different methods and means of collection and transportation of faecal sludge, like, manual collection techniques, mechanized collection techniques, etc. The different treatment objectives and treatment mechanisms of faecal management were also mentioned. The speaker then explained Omni Processor, proposed by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which treats and processes faecal sludge in countries like Sudan, etc. He concluded his speech by encouraging the students to take an online course on faecal sludge management. Around 100 students and 28 faculty members from Civil Engineering. Research Institute, Centre for Environmental Nuclear Research and School of Public Health participated in the lecture. </p>

                  <p>An Industrial visit to Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research , Kalpakkam was organized by the Civil  Engineering department of SRM Institute of Science and Technology on Friday, 10th August 2018,. M.Tech Environmental Engineering students (I st and II nd years) accompanied two faculties Mr. S.DHANASEKAR and Ms. V.MIRUNALINI visited IGCAR, Kalpakkam to interact with the scientists to understand the fast reactor science and technology and their effects on the environment. In this visit students were very eagerly waiting for listening to the centre’s scientists.
                    In the morning at 9.30 a.m we visited IGCAR,Kalpakkam. The Head of the BARC  training school, IGCAR Campus, conducted a very informative introductory session  for the students. Also she motivated the students to select their domain and area of interest. The team then observed the pictorial representation of the operations taking place in the fast breeder reactor. This session was followed by the control room visit. Dr. R. Mathiyarasu,Senior Scientist IGCAR – Radiology Safety Division, explained the students about the radiations that are emitted from the reactors. He also demonstrated the Environment, Health and  safety precaution methods. The testing laboratory equipments were explained. Then the students were given knowledge about the artificial Earthquake Stimulator and their operation mechanisms.
